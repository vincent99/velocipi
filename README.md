# VelociPi

## About

This runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 to control the screens, cameras, joysticks, audio, and various other toys in my Velocity V-Twin-6 N711ME.  I don't know why you're here, but good luck.

## Dev

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Build

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
